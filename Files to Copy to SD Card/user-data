#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# On first boot, set the (default) ubuntu user's password to "ubuntu" and
# expire user passwords
chpasswd:
  expire: true
  list:
  - ubuntu:ubuntu

# Enable password authentication with the SSH daemon
ssh_pwauth: true

## On first boot, use ssh-import-id to give the specific users SSH access to
## the default user
#ssh_import_id:
#- lp:my_launchpad_username
#- gh:my_github_username

## Add users and groups to the system, and import keys with the ssh-import-id
## utility
groups:
#- robot: [robot]
#- robotics: [robot]
- dedyms:
  gid: '1000' 
#
users:
- default
- name: dedyms
  gecos: Mr. Dedyms
  primary_group: dedyms
  groups: users
  lock_passwd: false
  hashed_passwd: '$6$.CDzrRTU$R.xZpXpfJhkXpoBgKljy/./xYFnEUZ3jkN861ZzTVc6phtLT61w6q1SpV2Uvl2lsw5sZsg1Lb52v3UV1k..vQ/'

#package_update: true
#package_upgrade: true

## Install additional packages on first boot
#packages:
#- pwgen
#- pastebinit
#- [libpython2.7, 2.7.3-0ubuntu3.1]

## Write arbitrary files to the file-system (including binaries!)
#write_files:
#- path: /etc/default/keyboard
